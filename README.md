# Dependency:

>python 3.10 - 3.12 (python 3.13 is too new for the MongoDB package)

>MongoDB(Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Install MongoDB with default settings and with compass.

Running the main will automatically setup the database and collections, but not populate them


# .CSV functionality

Open the excel file and save it as a .csv

There are still issues with the quality of the data: Duplicate entries are more or less ignored and multiple entries in one cell are stored as just one value

The exact format of the csv should not matter, as the program detects it itself. If there are suspected issues, please report them
